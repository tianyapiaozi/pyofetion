Pyofetion is a simple python binding for openfetion(http://code.google.com/p/ofetion/).

Pyofetion is a pure python module(using ctypes) that allows access to 
openfetion's libofetion library from Python. There is a sample code 
pycliofetion.py which implements the same function as the official 
cliofetion.

Pyofetion just provides a way to use libofetion library and I have to admit
 that it's not quite Pythonic to use pyofetion. The better way is to write 
python extension for libofetion.
